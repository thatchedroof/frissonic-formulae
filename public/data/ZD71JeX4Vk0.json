Stephanie, an optimistic girl with bright pink hair, comes to live in Lazy Town and meets a zany mix of townspeople, including the world\u2019s laziest super-villain, Robbie Rotten. Fortunately for Stephanie, Lazy Town is also under the watchful eye of Sportacus, an athletic, super-active, slightly-above-average hero, who runs, jumps, flips and flies to the rescue in his futuristic AirShip. Sportacus always manages to save the day and to help the kids of Lazy Town foil Robbie\u2019s latest lazy schemes.\n\nThe other kids of Lazy Town are inquisitive, adventurous, playful, and like Stephanie, just trying to figure out their own worlds. Each of them has strengths and weaknesses that all kids can identify withZiggy loves the sweet things in life but struggles to make healthy choices. Stingy has a hard time seeing the benefits of sharing. Pixel is learning how to respect his mind and body by moderating his computer and TV use. Trixie is learning how to make friends by not hurting others and respecting social conventions, and Stephanie is trying to stay true to what feels right for her.\n\nLazy Town is all about promoting a healthy lifestyle for children, in a positive, entertaining and catchy way and is recognized world-wide through channels such as the successful television series, live events and branded consumer products. This way Lazy Town encourages kids to be more active and lead healthier lives. We know that Lazy Town resonates because raising healthy, well-adjusted children is an objective we share with parents all across the world! There is a lot of different advice out there about how to succeed in raising happy, healthy kids but everyone can agree that having a healthy body, eating a balanced diet and being physically active are excellent ways to start.",
