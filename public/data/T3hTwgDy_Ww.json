Gonna keep it mellow.\nResponsible night for a polite fellow\nSay hello to my friends and comrades\nDon\u2019t tend to offend so I say perhaps\nJust two drinks! As a social courtesy.\nWe can raise a glass to our past fraternity\nAnd certainly a perfectly normal informal get together\nBut it\u2019s been forever since we gathered so whatever\nJust three drinks! For the sake of the old times.\nProceed with tequila shots with a dish full of cold limes.\nThe whole nine, laughing remembering all the old lines\nNever used to work but I could em give another try\nJust four drinks! Y\u2019know, take the edge off.\nI\u2019ve had a hard week, I deserve to get sauced.\nPick up another round as my friends depart and\nThey may not stick around but I just got started.\n\nCHORUS\nFeel so much better than usual\nI feel indisputable\n[ohhhh]\nI think that I might be beautiful\n\nVERSE 2\nJuuuuust five drinks! F***in' treat myself!\nPour the Dom Perignon from the back of the top shelf.\nSpend like god put on airs to sell it\nCrowd pretends not to care but I know they\u2019re jealous, just\nSix drinks! Let slip the dogs of war!\nI\u2019m gonna start a f***in' riot til I\u2019m tossed out the front door\nZero to sixty I can turn on a dime, I\u2019m hitting\nbottom and I\u2019m feeling like committing a crime. Just\nEight drinks! Maybe I\u2019ve lost count?\nI can\u2019t remember the night, what I drank, or the amount.\nI\u2019m fading in and out my very consciousness is crumbling.\n. . . Sorry, was I saying something?\nTwelve drinks! Strolling out of the hospital.\nIs it hair of the dog if you stay drunk and don\u2019t stop at all?\nAnother night losing it more than I can afford\nWas I just feeling bored? Am I that insecure?\n\nCHORUS\nFeel so much better than usual\nI feel indisputable\n[ohhhh]\nBut now I\u2019m feeling so beautiful\nDon\u2019t wake me up from this spell I\u2019m under if I\u2019m still breathing\nI know that I will be ugly when\nI feel like myself again\n[ohhhh]\nBut now I\u2019m feeling so beautiful\n\nBRIDGE\nBottle of scotch served on the rocks with a shot of cachaca\nVodka sake kamikaze with a handle of sherry a\ncherry brandy with a jaeger chaser champagne float\nA bourbon hot toddy in teacup of throat coat\nMartini bellini negroni baileys kahlua sambuca\nSoju paloma mojito gimlet frangelico guinness\nTequila manhattan a margarita old fashioned\nDry vermouth and something I can\u2019t taste cuz I\u2019m so trashed\n\nSoldiering over I\u2019m slower shoulder to shoulder with no one\nStumbling sobering making friends with a smoker\nI know I\u2019m less than upright, losing the fight with the ground\nThen someone hits the lights as they close for the night now\nTry to look at heaven and I can\u2019t see the stars\nA billion trillion eyes are winking as I walk between parked cars\nMetabolizing liquor while I\u2019m losing my friends\nI\u2019m gonna hate myself tomorrow then I\u2019ll do it again\n\nNaa na na na naa (etc)\n\nCHORUS\nFeel so much better than usual\nI feel indisputable\n[ohhhh]\nBut now I'm feeling so beautiful\nDon\u2019t wake me up from this spell I\u2019m under if I\u2019m still breathing\nI know that I will be ugly when\nI feel like myself again\n[ohhhh]\nBut now I\u2019m feeling so beautiful\nMy vision is blurry\nAs long as I\u2019m thirsty\nNobody can hurt me hurt me hurt me",
